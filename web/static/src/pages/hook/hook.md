hi my name is Dan I work on the react team and this is my first time in three homes and so sophie talked about these problems that I think most of you have encountered in react development and of course we could approach these problems one by one

so wu could try to solve them in isolation but it seems like solving one of them makes some other one worse
so for example if we try to solve the rapper hell by putting more logic into componets themselves then our components become larger and harder to refactor and then on the other hand if we try to split the components apart into smaller pieces and reuse those then we end up with more nests than in the component tree and we get the rapper hell again and finally in either case we have all the confusion that comes with the classes

so we think that this is because these are not three separate problems, we think that this is these are three symptoms of one problem and the problem is that react does not provide a simpler smaller lightweight primitive to add state or lifecycle than a lcass componet and so once you add a class component you can split it up further without introducing the rapper helm and in fact it's not a new problem so if you use react for like more than a couple of years you might remeber then when react came out it actually included a solution to this problem it was make sense so mix-ins allows you to reuse some methods between classes and this way you would not have all these rappers

should we add mix ends back to react.

The codes usualy make sense the rounds it's not like it's not broken but we don't encourage using mix-ins and react and blog post that we wrote code called mix--ins considered harmful on the react log where we explain that we think in our experience the problems that mix-ins create are worse than the problems that they solve so that's why we don't exncourage using mix-ins.

perhaps we could just can't solve this problem maybe its inherent to the react component model maybe we should just accept it or maybe in there is a perhaps there is different way we could write our components that doesn't suffer from either of these problems and that's what I'm going to talk about today but before I start I want to touch a little bit on the way we approach making changes and additions to react which is a year ago we set up an RFC process so RFC stands for request for comments and it means that whenever we want to make or somebody else wants to make a substantial change or addition to react they need to write up a proposal with detail in the motivation and detailed design of how this will work and so that's what we're going to do we're excited to announce that we ready to present a proposal for how we can solve these three problems and importantly this proposal does not have breaking changes or deprecations it is strictly additive it is opt-in and it adds some new api's which happens when they try to solve problems and we would love to hear your feedback on proposal which is why we're going to publish it today and thought about many ways we could share this proposal so maybe we just like right off in there write up an RFC and post it but sincewe were going to run react Kampf anyway we just decided to show it here and we're going to demo.
